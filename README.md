## Overview
This was a generally easy challenge, and I didn't run into many problems.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- TypeScript

### What I learned

I learnt alot working with the fetch API to get data from the Advice Slip API. I was really interesting learning how they both work and challenging at the same time.
In the future I'll be doing some more work with APIs and this was a good launching block for me.
